Greetings for the day Muhammad Yasin,
Before I write anything, please note this is is neither a sales pitch nor a request for employment.
I have been working on Digital Transformations, in Singapore, since last 8 years and have successfully led large business transformations for Defence as well as Commercial sectors. These transformations include Business Transformation and business driven IT solutions.
However, I am not conversant with the Transformations happening in UAE. I would like to meetup with you to discuss the transformation you might have led and share our experiences.
I am currently in the UAE for a few weeks. I would apppreciate if you could spare 30mins of your time for a face-to-face discussion, over coffee.
Regards
Siraj


Hi , I believe my expertise and experience are a close match to the Business Analyst requirement, as posted by you. I have over 15 years of experience in Business Analysis and Project Management. I am available immediately . We can discuss this in detail over chat or phone.
